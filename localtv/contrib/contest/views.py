# that the user hasn't voted for too many different videos. Note: AFAICT this
# just checks that the total number of votes is less than the total number of
# possible votes, rather than checking that the total number of votes for videos
# for a certain category is less than the max number of votes for a given
# category. Of course, the only way to actually track that would be to track
# votes on a (video, category) combination - i.e. on the through model.
